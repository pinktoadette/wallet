// Description:
// This is a naive implementation (and just a stupid idea altogether) of a shared wallet where users can:
// 1. Deposit funds in the contract and have their balances tracked.
// 2. A user should not be able to withdraw from their wallet until at least 2 blocks have passed since the wallet
// was initially created (not yet implemented).
// 3. Withdraw funds up to the amount that they have deposited.
// 4. The owner of the contract should also have the ability to emergency withdraw all of the funds.

// There are a number of bugs and security vulnerabilities.


// TODO:
// 1. Please remedy as many bugs/exploits as you can.

// 2. Implement the 2 block withdrawal time limit outlined in #2 above ^.

// 3. Deploy the contract to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet and send your recruiter the contract address.
